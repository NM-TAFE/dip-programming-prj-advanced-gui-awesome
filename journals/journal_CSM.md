# Week 1:

## Summary:

In the first week we as a team met in class and discussed on how we will go on with the project. We understood the 
requirements of the project. We also installed the project on our local machines and ran it to understand about the 
whole idea. Also, to understand the user requirements better we decided to chat with AI acting as the client for our 
requirements.

# Week 4:

## Summary:

For this week I decided to work on grouping timestamps together. Till now all timestamps were getting displayed on the 
screen but what we wanted was to group it in such a way that if the timestamps have a difference of 1(or is in range) 
between them and if they last more than 5 seconds we group it together. Otherwise, we displayed it as it is. However, 


### Issues and PRs

# Week 5:

## Summary:

In this week I uploaded the wireframes of our group to the repository and also updated my grouping timestamps function. 
After checking my code with my team members we discussed that grouping timestamps with just one second differnce is not 
a recommended option as well as displaying all timestamps is unnecessary. So we decided to enhance the grouping logic 
in such a way that  if the difference in seconds is 3 or less and the code lasts longer than 5 seconds then display the 
starting timestamps only.
