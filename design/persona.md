# Persona

## Name : 
    John 


## Description : 
    - Programming Student
    - Proficient in using the command line 
    - Comfortable executing basic commands and running scripts 
    - Relies heavily on screen readers and other assistive technologies
    - Prefers a mix of audio instructions and hands-on practice for learning
    - Frustrated with course content being predominantly video tutorials making it hard to follow along in class and keep up with other students


## User Stories 

    - As a blind coding student, I want to be able to know when code is on a video coding tutorial that Iâ€™m watching, 
        so that I can follow along with my lecturer

    - As a blind coding student, I want to have accessible code snippets of the coding videos, 
        so that I can follow along with the content without missing any code that appears on the screen

    - As a blind coding student, I want to receive a sound alert whenever a new code section begins in a video tutorial, 
        so that I can be aware of when to start paying closer attention

    - As a blind coding student, I want an interactive timestamps for coding videos where code snippets appear, 
        so that I can easily navigate to those sections

    - As a blind coding student, I want the option to adjust the playback speed of coding videos, 
        so that I can follow along at a pace as per my understanding. 
 

## Team Meeting

| Date  | Issues Discussed                         |
|-------|------------------------------------------|     
| 14/05 | Wireframes                               |
| 21/05 | Accessible Code Snippets                 |
| 28/05 | Navigable Code Snippets                  |
| 04/06 | Implement Sound Alerts for Code Sections |


## Needs

    - Accessible Code Snippets: 
            Accessible code snippets of code appearing in videos. 

    - Sound Alerts for Code Sections: 
            Sound alerts indicating when a new code section starts and ends in video tutorials. 

    - Navigable Code Snippets: 
            An interactive timestamps within videos that allow to jump directly to different code sections. 


## Validation

You will validate your design by meeting with a user representative: the product owner (in this case, your lecturer).

## Meeting minutes

- [ ] Meeting held on 18/06
- [ ] Persona discussed: John
- [ ] Design artefacts reviewed: wireframes.png, persona.md
- [ ] Issues discussed: 
  1. Different video styles (tutorial vs demonstration): Dynamic captures
  2. Customization of keyboard shortcuts
  3. Focus on code block whenever it's updated
  4. Add setting for pausing video when navigating through the timestamps
- [x] Feedback provided: 

## What worked well

- [ ] Good collaboration and communication, Distributed issues efficiently

## What could be improved

- [ ] Documentation, wireframes, User stories, Issue descriptions

## What will you change before the next meeting

- [ ] Testing with different types of coding videos, Customizable keyboard shortcuts

## Were there any questions that needed to be discussed with the user
  1. Reason for frustration while watching coding videos
  2. What is the motivation for creating this application
    - Lecturers tutorials heavily reliant on videos

## Lecturer's checklist (to be used by the lecturer)

- [ ] Persona is well defined
- [ ] Persona is relevant to the application
- [ ] Design artifacts are present and easy to follow
- [ ] Design decisions are based on user needs and goals
- [ ] Appropriate considerations of interaction patterns appropriate for the user
- [ ] Efforts towards realizing at least one significant issue involving user interaction
- [ ] Whole team engagement in the design process
